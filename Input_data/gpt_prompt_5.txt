this is a simple static html (only the body).
Add basic bootstrap 4.0 colors to different backgrounds and texts.
(like bg-light or text-warning from the bootstrap color palette)
the webpage should look as pleasing as possible.
Use only bootstrap 4.0 classes, no style tags.
also seperate elements with <br> tags if it looks better this way.
