this is a simple static html webpage (only the body).
Add class = " " attributes to a lot of these html elements:
Use bootstrap cards to group the html content typically.
Also use the bootstrap magins and paddings to display everything as pleasing as possible.
Use only bootstrap 4.0 classes, no style tags.
If necessary add some html tags.
