this is a simple static html webpage (only the body).
Add class = " " attributes to a lot of these html elements:
Use the bootstrap grid system to allign the elements nicely.
(like centered or next to each other)
Also add or change the bootstrap magins and paddings to display everything as pleasing as possible.
Use only bootstrap 4.0 classes, no style tags.
If necessary add some html tags.
