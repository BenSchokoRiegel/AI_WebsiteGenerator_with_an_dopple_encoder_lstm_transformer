You will receive an abstract and undetailed description of an HTML page as PlantUML. You will turn it into an actual static HTML page as code.

add always bootstrap to the head:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.3.1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T" crossorigin="anonymous">

The PlantUML has no information about styling. Do following things to your own accord:
Add some <br> elements.
Add style = " " to the elements and use bootstrap classes to style them nicely.
Add some <div> around other elements to style them further as you please.
Use the bootstrap grid system a lot to align Items!
Use Bootstrap cards to display content grouped.
Use Bootstrap borders.
Use Bootstrap colors for text, backgrounds and more.
Don't use any <script> tags exept a Bootstrap JavaScript file for enhanced functionality.

You will make the webpage aesthetically pleasing as possible with only bootstrap classes.
Output only a single HTML code block without further comments.
If you understand these instructions answer with "Ready".
